# TurnItIn Rubric Converter

I suspect many educators have been frustrated by the fact that rubrics created in TurnItIn can only be directly exported in .rbc format, which can't be directly used in anything else. In order to add these to my Moodle pages in a visual format, I've created a tool for converting TurnItIn rubrics in excel or csv format for inclusion in teaching materials and suchlike.

The tool is based on a python script, but all you need to do to use it is download the rubric_converter_gui.exe file. This will open up the interface shown below - simply browse to select your rubric file downoaded from TurnItIn, select whether you'd like your output in csv or excel format, and then click the second browse button to set a save location and file name for the converted rubric. Simple!
